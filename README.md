# is.onboard

## Aim of the site

This is a site that is used to on-board new employees of a (fictional) company. It is specifically focussed on the Information Systems (IS) department, and the new employee's 
relationship and induction with the IS function. It allows them to walk away from the experience with an understanding of how IS works for **them**, and what equipment choices they have to make that are relevant to their role. 

**Link to live site:** https://stuartcox3107.github.io/is.onboard/ (opens in same tab, click back if needed)

## User stories

"As a new employee: I want to walk away from this interaction with the feeling that the company and the IS department are professional and have provided me with 
an online induction tailored towards **my** needs and the needs of my role. I want the experience to be quick and simple and to give me all the information **I** need to make the relevant choices to 
do my job effectively. I want to understand what the next steps are in terms of me starting my new role and how IS fits in with this."

"As a manager in the IS department: I want to be certain that the new employee is being offered the right equipment for their role but can make choices that tailor the choice to their own preferences. 
I want to know that they have a good understanding of 
the point of contact relevant to **their** new role should they have any issues. I want them to walk away from the experience knowing exactly what the next steps are."

"As a senior manager in the company: I want to be certain that my new employees are engaged with the company from the start, and that they do not waste valuable 
time after actually starting their roles in working through what equipment they actually need to perform their role. I want to be sure that they have choices available to them 
that meet the needs of their role, their own personal preferences, and also within the boundaries of the purchasing cost restraints"

"As a supply chain manager: I want to be confident that all new starters are receiving products that are from our nominated suppliers"

## Theme & typography

The site will be a single page site with 6 different views, the first view will gather the name and employee number of the new starter and the 
views following this will change according to which department the employee will be working in, or from previous choices made by them. If for example they work in the 
marketing department they will be presented with the option of laptop A or laptop B, if they choose laptop B then they will be presented with the relevant sized laptop case options.
Navigation will purely be through NEXT buttons. 

Given the target users are new employees, the site needs to be professional in terms of style & look to convey the feeling of professionalism.
The company would want to present itself as slick and professional, and the site should convey this. It should be very simple to use and need few instructions for use.

- Linear navigation, one step at a time using only "NEXT" to progress
- Simple, quick, intuitive. Asks exactly what is needed only
- Questions and display is based on either the department of the new employee or previous equipment choices made
- Overview of choices needed to be made with links present to further details if needed
- Simple pages, no information overload

## Features left to implement

- Not in the scope of this project, but future plans would be to automate follow up emails on progress
- Not in the scope of this project, but future plans would be to link this to inductions of all divisions of the company
