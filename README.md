This is a site that is used to on-board new employees of a (fictional) company. It is specifically focussed on the Information Systems (IS) department, and the new employees 
relationship with the IS function. It allows them to walk away from the experience with an understanding of how IS works for **them**, and what choices they have to make that are relevant to their role. 

## UX

As a new employee: I want to walk away from this interaction with the feeling that the company and the IS department are professional and have provided me with 
an online induction tailored towards **my** needs. I want the experience to be quick and simple and to give me all the information **I** need to make the relevant choices to 
do my job effectively. I want to understand what the next steps are in terms of me starting my new role and how IS fits in with this.

As a manager in the IS department: I want to be certain that the new employee is being offered the right equipment for their role and they have a good understanding of 
the point of contact relevant to **their** new role should they have any issues. I want them to walk away from the experience knowing exactly what the next steps are.

As a senior manager in the company: I want to be certain that my new employees are engaged with the company from the start, and that they do not waste valuable 
time after actually starting in working through what they actually need to perform their role.
